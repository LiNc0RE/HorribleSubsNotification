# HorribleSubsNotification
Very little python script to notify myself of newly uploaded anime episodes. Uses balloontip.py and feedparser

It checks the RSS feed of nyaa.se every 3 minutes. Only notifies of anime listed in whitelist. Also only works for HorribleSubs releases in 720p

baloontip.py : https://gist.github.com/BoppreH/4000505

feedparser: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser
